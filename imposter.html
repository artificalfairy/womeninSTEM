        <h3>What is Imposter Syndrome?</h3>
        <h2>Simply put, women who suffer from imposter syndrome do not feel worthy of the praise they receive on the basis of their academic or professional accomplishments, essentially feeling as if theyâ€™re a fraud. Many people who have imposter syndrome question whether they deserve their title and doubt their ability and success. 70% of people were shown to have imposter syndrome with the majority being high achieving women in subjects such as STEM.</h2>
